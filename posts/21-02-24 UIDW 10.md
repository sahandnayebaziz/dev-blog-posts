UI Designer Weekly is back after our holiday break!

It's a pleasure to be back in your inbox. I have some plans to improve this newsletter by possibly recreating the website to emphasize super high resolution images and making other legibility improvements. If you have any requests, I'd love to hear from you.

I hope you're having a great week and find something inspiring here to mix into your work.

### [Just under and in a Bit](https://cur.at/bARsIkS?m=web)

A simple caption style on Apple Newsroom. Clean and clear to read with a fresh download button on the opposite side.

### Context Menus Can Be Beautiful Too

Something quite nice about the organization of this Menu in Maps on macOS.
