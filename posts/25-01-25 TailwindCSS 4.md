Congrats to the Tailwind CSS team on the launch of v4. Between personal projects and client projects, I've probably designed and built 4-5 websites per year the last few years. Truly couldn't do it without Tailwind, which I use on every one.

There new update has some really nice improvements like being able to use any number for some properties like margin (`mt-19` is now possible), an updated color range that uses P3 for more vibrancy, and moving a lot of the configuration that used to be in JS right into CSS itself.

I made my first website ever on MacRabbit's *Espresso* back in the day. Would have been great if Tailwind existed back then, let me tell you.
