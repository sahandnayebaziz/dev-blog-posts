Congrats to the Tailwind CSS team on the launch of v4. Between personal projects and client projects, I've probably designed and built 4-5 websites per year the last few years. Truly couldn't do it without Tailwind, which I use on every one.

This update has some nice improvements: you can now use any number for some properties like margin (`mt-19` is now possible), there's an updated color palette that's made for P3, and you can configure Tailwind directly in CSS now instead of having to use a JS file.

I made my first website ever on MacRabbit's *Espresso* back in the day. Would have been great if Tailwind existed back then, let me tell you.
