Apple News+ magazines on a 12.9-inch iPad Pro should look and feel amazing, but sadly that’s not where we’re at today. In this post I’ll show what is frustrating about the experience and how things could be improved. 

## MAGAZINE COVERS

Here's a current A-list magazine and my iPad side-by-side. We can see they're similar enough in size:

Now here’s what it looks like when you open this magazine on the iPad:

The frustration begins and the reading experience is interrupted as soon as you notice you’re not able to see the whole cover *without scrolling.*

The frustration continues a few seconds after starting to read the cover: it’s not in sharp, Retina-resolution, but blurry and noticeably pixelated. You’d be forgiven for thinking we're waiting for a progressive JPEG to load, but this is it.

This is strange to me and immediately makes this viewing experience less fun. How could this be? What part of the pipeline could be limiting the magazine covers from looking sharp? 

You see this with all the other big magazines on the 12.9-inch iPad. Here’s a screenshot of Wired, The Atlantic, WSJ, etc.

### THE FIX

The covers should be sharp, Retina-resolution images. They should be "fit" instead of "filled" on the screen. Here's a quick mockup of how that could look:

## TABLES OF CONTENTS

Okay well let's move on from the cover. Maybe it's easy to "flip through" the articles to find something good to read so we can finally sit back on the couch, iPad in hand.

Here's what the table of contents looks like on the magazine:

![It's not that creative, but we a big photo for one of the inside stories and short descriptions for the others.](https://assets.sahandnayebaziz.org/the-frustration-of-apple-news-plus/magazine-TOC.jpg)

Here's what it looks like on the iPad:

![No story thumbnails, no descriptions, just story titles?](https://assets.sahandnayebaziz.org/the-frustration-of-apple-news-plus/ipad-TOC-2.jpg)

It's all just text. That's surprising. We can't see any pictures previewing the stories inside. Not the photography, not the graphic design language, not even a simple preview of the estimated reading time for each piece. 

We have to tap into Contents and then into each piece, over and over, or swipe through with no way to quickly scan. This is just worse than a real issue, where we can flip through with our fingers, dog-ear pages, and zoom to a particular place in the issue.

And right about now is when I close the News app, put down my iPad, and remember why I don't read magazines on my iPad.

## It Could Be So Much Better

*I'm not mad, I'm just disappointed.* I love magazines, I love Apple, I love HI design teams at Apple... I love all of it. That's why I'm writing this post. All I want is for these things to be improved. Here's how:


First, the easiest and lowest-hanging fruit: Make the cover high resolution and fit it to my iPad screen!


It should be retina and look great on a 12.9-inch iPad Pro, and it should just be fit to the screen so I can see the whole cover at once, like a normal magazine cover. (And if it can't look great on an iPad Pro 12.9, what does that say about this iPad?)

Second, make the table of contents more visually appealing. Add thumbnails, add reading times, make it something that pulls me in to each other article.

Here's a mockup of how this could look with the most minimal changes I could think of:

![Simple thumbnails for each story would go a long way.](https://assets.sahandnayebaziz.org/the-frustration-of-apple-news-plus/make-the-toc-good.jpg)

We should be using the marvelous powers of technology (and Apple's best-in-class user interface components) to make the magazine easier to navigate.

## Final Thoughts

That's all. Again, I want to restate that I have the utmost respect and admiration for the people who worked on this to get it this far. I know it must be difficult to be innovating and pushing in the magazine industry, an industry that has arguably faced nothing but headwinds for the last who knows how many years. And it's amazing to have this breadth of choice, rolled into Apple One, at my fingertips.

But, that doesn't mean that what this app offers today is good enough to allow me to actually use it. I'm someone who wants to use Apple News+, who wants to tell my friends about it, share stories, and keep paying for it for the foreseeable future. And yet, I can't because many small frustrations add up to an experience that I don't look forward to repeating.

I'll be waiting patiently for that silent update someday when Apple News+ suddenly gets a whole lot better, and rooting for them all along.
