### Recents

Welcome back to another issue of UI Designer Weekly!

WWDC is this upcoming Monday, June 7th. This is a great time to get some rest and get ready to take all the new stuff in.

This week is light! I wanted to feature this set of overlays that have been used more and more recently. Other than that, I hope you have a great weekend. See you next week for detailed coverage of WWDC 21.

### A Bold Headline with Some Friends

A bold font is used above a lighter style in this Apple Pencil overlay. Displaying the battery icon in color makes it easy to get a little more information with each glance: is the battery full or running low?

### The Gang’s All Here

A bright, clear menu of actions for the copy-and-paste family. This is a good example of showing actions anyway even when they can’t be done but showing them “greyed out”. This pattern can be traced back to macOS menus.

### Nothing But Text

As simple as it gets in the bold style.

### Helping People Get a Handle on It

Rounded rectangles with a little padding are used to indicate a “handle” area where a design can be dragged around.

### A Small Hint

Another place rounded rectangles call out as “handles”.
