I’m going to have a lot more to say about this, but I wanted to jot down some of my first thoughts.

- I think it’s beautiful
- The lensing of content behind the glass works best when there is motion for the glass to reflect
- To me this suggests a big investment in future screenless interfaces where the UI is meant to be in front of “anything”
- I’m digging that we are moving to a more monochrome style
- The “clear” home screen option is incredible in that it proves  that
