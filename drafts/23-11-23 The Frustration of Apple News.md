Reading magazines on my 12.9-inch iPad Pro should be an excellent experience but for many reasons it’s not. In this post I’m going to share with you why I think it’s frustrating and how I think it could be so much better.

I’m reading Apple News+ magazines from top publishers like Condé Nast (hello to my former employer!) on an M2 iPad Pro (hello to my other former employer!) which is the latest and most expensive iPad available at time of writing. 

Why does it matter which iPad it is? I’d say if you’re paying for the iPad with the biggest screen, the best display quality, and the fastest processing, it’s fair to want the best of the *Apple* experience. You know it when you see it.

But do we see it here?

## Calibrating Our Expectations

Alright, many have waxed poetic about the difference between physical books and e-books—I’m not here to address this today. For our purposes, we are going to assume that reading a magazine on an iPad is a fine and well thing to desire to do. We are going to compare what you get between the two modes of reading, but we are not going to question the validity of either.

So given that, I have the following expectations for what reading a magazine on an iPad would be like:

- It looks great
- It’s easy to use
- It’s fast

 Now let’s see what we actually get today with an Apple News+ subscription…

## The Frustrating Things

Let’s take a look at a well-integrated Apple News+ magazine: Vogue. Their issues do all of the Apple News-y things, they are a top magazine, this should be good. 

Let’s open the latest issue.

Right off the bat, the cover image is visibly low-res and pixelated. 

Not only is it not sharp, it’s not even all in view*. I have to scroll to see the whole cover. How could that be?
