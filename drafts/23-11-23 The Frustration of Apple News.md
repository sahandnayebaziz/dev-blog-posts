Reading magazines on my 12.9-inch iPad Pro should be an excellent experience but for many reasons it’s not. I’m going to share with you why I think it’s frustrating and how I think it could be so much better.

Specifically, I’m reading magazines in Apple News+, magazines from top publishers like Condé Nast (hello to my former employer!) on an M2 iPad Pro (hello to my other former employer!) which is the latest and most expensive iPad available at time of writing. Why does it matter which iPad it is? I’d say if you’re paying for the iPad with the biggest screen, the best display quality, and the fastest processing, it’s fair to want the best of the you-know-it-when-you-see-it Apple experience.

But do we see it here?

## Calibrating Expectations

Alright, many have waxed poetic about the difference between physical books and e-books—I’m not here to address this today. For our purposes, we are going to assume that reading a magazine on an iPad is a fine and well thing to desire to do. We are going to compare what you get between the two modes of reading, but we are not going to question the validity of either.

In 2023, magazines on the iPad should...

- Look great
- Be easy to use

*That's it!* Let's see how much of this we accomplish. 

## Reality Sinks In

Here's the magazine and my iPad side-by-side. You can see they're basically the same size:

So we should be good to go, then right?  Let's open this magazine up on the iPad...

Uh-oh, we can't see the whole cover! It's cut off and we actually need to scroll down to see the whole thing.

Next, you'll notice that it's actually not even sharp. The image is noticeably blurry and pixelated. You might think you're waiting for a progressive JPEG to fully load in, but no, this is actually the best we're going to get.

So you don't even get to take in a beautiful cover. Think about it... at the magazine office, they go through commissioning a great photo, having their graphic design team create an elegant layout, and likely overworking their copy editors to get to the perfect pairing of words to make a beautiful cover, and after all of that we can't even see it in crisp, high resolution. I'm sure the source file is a *huge* Adobe InDesign (Photoshop?) canvas that has more than enough fidelity for us to get a retina end result.

Okay well let's move on from the cover. Maybe it's easy to "flip through" the articles inside, find something good to read, maybe even quickly bookmark my favorites *YouTube-Watch-Later* style and then sit back and relax on my couch like Steve Jobs did at the original iPad announcement.

Here's what the table of contents looks like on the real issue:

Here's what it looks like on the iPad:

It's all just text. That's surprising. You can't see any visuals previewing the stories inside. Not the photography, not the graphic design language, not even a simple preview of the estimated reading time for each piece. 

You have to tap into Contents and then into each piece, over and over, or swipe through with no way to quickly scan. This is just worse than a real issue, where you can flip through with your fingers, dog-ear pages, and zoom to a particular place in the issue.  

And right about now is when I close the News app, put down my iPad, and remember why I don't read magazines on my iPad.

## It Could Be So Much Better

*I'm not mad, I'm just disappointed.* I love magazines, I love Apple, I love HI design teams at Apple... I love all of it. That's why I'm writing this post. All I want is for these things to be improved. Here's how:

1. The easiest, lowest-hanging fruit. Make the cover high resolution and fit it to my iPad screen!

Again, here's how it looks today:

And here's how it could look:

<pic of magazine fit>

It should be retina and look great on an iPad Pro 12.9, and it should just be fit to the screen so I can see the whole cover at once, like a normal magazine cover. (And if it can't look great on an iPad Pro 12.9, what does that say about this iPad?)

2. Make the table of contents more visually appealing. Add thumbnails, add reading times, make it something that pulls me in to each other article.

Here's how it looks today and how it could look instead:

We should be using the marvelous powers of technology (and Apple's best-in-class user interface components) to make the magazine easier to navigate, not harder to navigate.

## Final Thoughts

That's all. Again, I want to restate that I have the utmost respect and admiration for the people who worked on this to get it this far. I know it must be difficult to be innovating and pushing in the magazine industry, an industry that has arguably faced nothing but headwinds for the last who knows how many years. And it's amazing to have this breadth of choice, rolled into Apple One, at my fingertips.

But, that doesn't mean that what this app offers today is good enough to allow me to actually use it. I'm someone who wants to use Apple News+, who wants to tell my friends about it, share stories, and keep paying for it for the foreseeable future. And yet, I can't.

I'll be waiting patiently for that silent update one day when Apple News+ suddenly gets a whole lot better.
