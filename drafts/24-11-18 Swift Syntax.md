A long-standing request I've heard for [DetailsPro](https://detailspro.app) is for the generated SwiftUI code to show in the editor with syntax highlighting. In the early days of the app, I thought that this would just be something I'd get to eventually. Now as DetailsPro enters its fifth year on the App Store, I figured it was time to get it working.

As I explored options for how to get it done, I quickly discovered [@swift/swift-syntax](https://apple.com), an Apple-made library that can parse and abstract Swift code and, among other uses, be used for syntax highlighting. This was perfect, so I thought i'd write up a blog post about it.

## HOPES FOR A SOLUTION

I had a few requirements I wanted to hit with a new dependency in DetailsPro that was going to help with snytax highlight.
