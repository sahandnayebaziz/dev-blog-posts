Apple has released the only official images of the new, “full-on” CarPlay that we’ve seen since the original announcement at WWDC22. I’m fascinated by the possibilities here of Apple designing everything you’d see in a car, and I think there’s an angle here that many of us might not have seen coming where the designs are actually tailored to each car.
